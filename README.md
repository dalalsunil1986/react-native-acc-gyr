# react-native-acc-gyr
Displays Native accelerometer and gyroscope data on IOS/Android

# info
* In IOS the output is mesured in `gforces`
* Android's accelerometer outputs acceleration in `meters per second squared`, if you want to convert the acceleration into a g-force measurement, divide it by 9.81 (gravitational pull on earth).
